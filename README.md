# mtf - music theory fun

simple, naive, inaccurate and czech-variable-named attempt to model music theory basics in java

goals:

- hands on experience with java records
- hands on experience with junit 5
- define basic elements and verify values using junit tests (tones, intervals, scales,...)
- learn music theory through trial and error
- have fun :)
